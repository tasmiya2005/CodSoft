This repository contains a collection of Java development projects completed as part of an internship program with Codsoft, a leading software development company. The projects demonstrate my skills and understanding of Java programming concepts, data structures, and software development principles.

Task 1: Number Guessing Game
The Number Guessing Game is a console-based game that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user has 10 attempts to guess the number, and the game provides feedback on each guess. The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays the result at the end.
